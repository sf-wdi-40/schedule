## Monday, September 25
1. Finish the Project 2: Codename Vagabond reflection survey.
2. Do a code review of your Vagabond project. Go through the code and take time for the code-cleanup steps you couldn't during the project:
    * Refactor repeated code into methods.
    * Rename variables and methods to be more semantic.
    * Clean up your CSS files to be concise while still including the necessary rules.
    * Rename routes to be more semantic, or more RESTful.
2. Start thinking about ideas for Project 3. We'll have super quick (20 seconds or so) pitches for those ideas on Wednesday morning.

## Monday, September 11
1. Complete a Ruby health check to make sure you're ready for tomorrow! Below, I've listed the commands I ran, and their output on my computer. Please run these on your computer and make sure they're similar (don't have to be identical). If anything doesn't work, try to fix it and reach out if you need help, because we'll start using these tools tomorrow!
2. Read through the feedback & comments on your Project 1 code. We'll go over a couple of common themes tomorrow morning.

Health check:

## Tuesday, August 29
1. Create a CRUD application using MongoDB with Mongoose to produce a todo list.
2. Frontend can be found here: https://github.com/arun-projects/Todo-List
3. Don't worry about forking the frontend provided. Simply create a new repository.
4. A couple of articles to checkout as well re: multi vs single-page web apps.<br>
[Eikos article](http://www.eikospartners.com/blog/multi-page-web-applications-vs.-single-page-web-applications)<br>
[Medium article](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58)

## Monday, August 28
1. Create a full CRUD application using the "persons" API and provided frontend.
2. Frontend can be found here: https://github.com/arun-projects/User-Manager
3. For the API, you will be using the "Person API" on the MyAPI dashboard: http://myapi-profstream.herokuapp.com
4. Don't worry about forking the frontend provided. Simply create a new repository.

## Friday, August 25
1. Finish and submit the [Spotify Lab](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/spotify-search-lab)! Make a music search app using jQuery, AJAX, and the Spotify API. You'll be using Spotify's search endpoint to search for tracks (songs). Note that we ask you to submit this lab with a pull request--you can find specific directions on how to do that [here](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/shared_modules/blob/master/how-to/submit-homework.md).
2. If you finish the Spotify Lab try refactoring your racing game or read some more documentation on Nodejs.
3. Add tests to your Spotify lab. Pick a function that you've written, and figure out how to test that its inputs/outputs work they way you intended. (Note that if you're testing something like an AJAX call, you'll definitely need to use the `done()` functionality of Mocha!)
